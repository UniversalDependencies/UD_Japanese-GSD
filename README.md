# Summary

This Universal Dependencies (UD) Japanese treebank is based on the definition of UD Japanese convention described in the UD documentation.  The original sentences are from Google UDT 2.0.


# Introduction

The Japanese UD treebank contains the sentences from Google Universal Dependency Treebanks v2.0 (legacy): https://github.com/ryanmcd/uni-dep-tb.  First, Google UDT v2.0 was converted to UD-style with bunsetsu-based word units (say "master" corpus).

The word units in "master" is significantly different from the definition of the documents based on **Short Unit Word** (SUW) [1], then the sentences are automatically re-processed by Hiroshi Kanayama in Feb 2017.  It is the Japanese_UD v2.0 and used in the CoNLL 2017 shared task.
In November 2017, UD_Japanese v2.0 is merged with the "master" data so that the manual annotations for dependencies can be reflected to the corpus. It reduced the errors in the dependency structures and relation labels.

Still there are slight differences in the word unit between UD_Japanese v2.1 and UD_Japanese-KTC 1.3.

In May 2020, we introduce UD_Japanese BCCWJ[3] like coversion method for UD_Japanese GSD v2.6.

# Specification


## Overview
The data is tokenized manually in a three layered tokenization of Short Unit Word (SUW)[4], Long Unit Word (LUW)[5], and base-phrase (bunsetsu)[5] as the `Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese'[6]. The original morporlogical labels are based on UniDic POS tagset [7]
We use the slightly changed version of SUW as the UD word tokenization, in which the cardinal numbers are concatenated as in one word.

The (base-)phrase level dependency structures are annotated manually with the gudeline of BCCWJ-DepPara[8]. The phrase level dependency structures are converted into the word level dependency structures by the head rule of the dependency analyser CaboCha[9]. 

## LEMMA field

LEMMA is the base form of conjugated words -- verbs, adjectives, and auxiliary verbs by the UniDic schema [7].

## XPOS field

XPOS is the part-of-speech label for Short Unit Word (SUW) based on UniDic POS tagset [7].

## MISC field

- SpaceAfter: manually annotated to discriminate alphanumeric word tokens

- BunsetuPositionType: heads in a bunsetu by the head rules [9];
  - SEM_HEAD: the head content word
  - SYN_HEAD: the head functional word
  - CONT: the non-head content word
  - FUNC: the non-head functional word

- LUWPOS: the part-of-speech label for Long Unit Word (LUW) based on UniDic POS tagset [7].

- LUWBILabel: Long Unit Word (LUW) boundary labels [5]
  - B: Beginning of LUW
  - I: Inside of LUW
  
- UniDicInfo: lemma information based on UniDic [7]. The UniDic lemma normalise
 not only conjugation forms but also orthographical variants.
  - 1 lForm: lexeme reading （語彙素読み）
  - 2 lemma: lexeme （語彙素）
  - 3 orth: Infinitive Form and Surface Form (書字形出現形）
  - 4 pron: Surface Pronunciation （発音形出現形）
  - 5 orthBase: Infinitive Form （書字形基本形）
  - 6 pronBase: Surface Pronunciation（発音形基本形）
  - 7 form: Word Form （語形）
  - 8 formBase: Word Form （語形基本形）
